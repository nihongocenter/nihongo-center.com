				"en": "1 – <strong>A Curriculum Vitae </strong> (original form of Nihongo Center). If you graduated from high school or university over 5 years ago, when you apply for the student visa, your CV will be sent to the immigration with the rest of your documents. That is why it is really important to correctly answer the 3 questions asked in the “Reason for study” section. Furthermore, it is required to write it either in English or to provide a translation of the “Reason for study” section.\n\n 2 - <strong>Passport Copy:</strong> The passport copy will be sent to the immigration so please be sure to send us a good quality one. Every character must be visible. If the immigration cannot read your name or any other information they will ask you to send a new one.\n\n3 – <strong>Face photo:</strong> The photo will be sent to the immigration and will be used for your Certificate of Eligibility, so be sure to send us a high-quality photo. Also, it must be an official photo so the background should be white. Please DO NOT send us selfies.\n\n 4 –<strong> Diploma:</strong> Please send us a copy of your last diploma. You can send it in your mother tongue, however, be sure to attach a copy in English.\n\n 5 –<strong> Pledge</strong> (original form of Nihongo Center):  The “Pledge” needs to be signed by yourself to attest that you will follow the rules of Nihongo Center and Japan.\n\n 6 – <strong>Letter of Guarantee 1&2</strong> (original form of Nihongo Center): These documents are necessary to have information about your financial guarantor.  The financial guarantor doesn’t have to be Japanese. In fact, it MUST be a relative or yourself. Fiancé, friends or Japanese friends cannot become your financial guarantor. Furthermore, remember that this document is asked for to make sure you have (or will receive) enough resources to pay the school fee, as well as living expenses in Japan during your studies. This means that it’s better to write the relative who will have the highest annual income.\n\n <em><u> All the following documents should be provided by the financial guarantor.</em></u>\n\n You can be your own guarantor however the required resources will be more because you will be unable to earn money when you first arrive in Japan.\n\n 7 –<strong> Proof of employment:</strong> This document must be submitted by your employer or by the employer of your financial guarantor. Generally, it specifies the information about the guarantor as follows:\n\n - The name of the employee\n\n - The start date of the employment\n\n - His/Her annual income\n\n8 –<strong> Proof of annual income:</strong> There are different ways to submit this information.  As mentioned before you can get it when you ask for a proof of employment of your guarantor. The second way is to send us a tax return form where the annual income is usually mentioned.\n\n 9 – <strong>Bank statement:</strong> This document is the most important one if you decide to be your own guarantor since the immigration will use it to determinate if you have enough resources to live or not. This document is submitted to the immigration in most of the cases. Here again, there might be alternatives of the document, but the name of the owner of the account, and the amount must be written.  Since it must be the most recent one, we always ask to send us the bank statement at least one month before the application deadline (May or November)."

Furthermore, only people from countries and regions with short-term visa exemptions are able to renew their tourist visa, by leaving Japan after their first 3 months and re-entering to receive another visa for 3 months. You don’t necessarily have to go back to your own country as long as you leave Japan for at least 3 days."
