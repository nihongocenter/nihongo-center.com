			of what was once the capital of Japan for over a thousand years. Kyoto has a very rich history
			and is known for its beautifully designed temples and shrines. The balance
			of studying Japanese in the morning and enjoying the city life in the afternoon makes Kyoto
			one of the most attractive locations for students in Japan. There are lots of universities and
			other educational institutions where you can continue to utilize your Japanese language skills.
